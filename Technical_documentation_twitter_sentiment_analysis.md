Technical Documentation:

Description: 
The code can be used for processing live data streams from a JSON source using Spark Streaming. It performs various data analysis tasks, such as sentiment analysis, trend analysis, and emoji analysis, on the Twitter data. The processed data is visualized using word clouds and other plots for better insights. The code can be customized by modifying the functions or adding additional transformations or analyses as per the specific requirements of the data stream.

Libraries:

The code imports several Python libraries that are used for various functionalities:

```
pyspark.sql.SparkSession: Represents the entry point for working with data in Spark SQL.

numpy: Provides functions for performing numerical operations on arrays and matrices.

pandas: Provides data manipulation and analysis tools, including data frames for working with structured data.

matplotlib.pyplot: Provides functions for creating visualizations, such as plots and charts.

wordcloud: Provides functions for creating word clouds, which are visual representations of the most frequently occurring words in a text.

emoji: Provides functions for working with emojis in text data.

nltk: Provides natural language processing functions, such as tokenization, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.

```

Functions:

The code defines several functions for performing different tasks:

```
get_emojis(sentence): Extracts emojis from a given sentence and calculates their occurrence.

twitter_data_trend_analysis(df_twitter_pandas): Performs trend analysis on Twitter data by creating a word cloud visualization of the most frequently occurring words in the data.

clean_words(new_tokens): Cleans Twitter data by converting words to lowercase, removing stop words, non-alphabetic characters, and lemmatizing words.

readdatastream(): Reads data as a stream using Spark Streaming from a JSON source and returns a DataFrame.

writestream(df): Invokes all transformations and performs data analysis on the streaming data by triggering the streaming query and writing the output to a specified checkpoint location.

batch_function(df, epochId): Performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data by extracting emojis and analyzing the occurrence of words in the data. Also, saves a trend analysis report as a PNG file.

main(): The main function that orchestrates the execution of other functions.
